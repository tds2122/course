Competitors were given a wide range of information about various stores in Germany, and were tasked with trying to predict sales on a number of days. The goal was to help the company to manage stock properly and be able to satisfy demand without holding unnecessary inventory. The official training set provided a lot of information about the stores. It was also permitted for competitors to use additional data, as long as that data was made public and available to all participants.\n",
